# Bytemotion ML Masterclass 2016

Interactive masterclass on some Machine Learning concepts taken place at the [Bytemotion Association for Technology](http://www.bytemotion.it) location on the 28th and 29th of December 2016.

* **Main Goal**: having fun, learning something
* **Specific goals**: understand some basic concepts in Machine Learning/Supervised Learning and familiarise with Python for Data Science

The ``masterclass'' is meant to be interactive!

## Software Requirements


We'll use Python (2.7) and its libraries for Data Science. Can install them with the package manager `pip`

```py
pip install sklearn
pip install jupyter
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
```

## Programme and Tasks

#### Data minining and manipulation

This notebook gives a super quick overview of Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation / data mining in Python. Just the basics to get us started.

#### Classification

We'll perform a classification of Iris flowers using a Decision Tree and a later a Random Forest.

#### Regression

We'll predict the brain weight of humans given the head size. Then we'll predict the rating given to cereals given their nutritional attributes.

## Data

The data we will use is referenced and described in the specific notebooks.

* the Iris dataset for classification
* The head size - brain weight dataset for simple linear regression
* The healthy breakfast dataset for multiple linear regression
